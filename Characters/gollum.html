            Gollum is a character who was once a hobbit named Sm√©agol but was
            corrupted by a powerful ring, turning him into a twisted and obsessed
            creature. He's known for his peculiar way of speaking and his deep
            connection to the One Ring, which he calls "my precious."</p></center>
